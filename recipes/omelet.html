    <p>A vegetarian omelette is a dish made by whisking eggs and cooking them in a pan, often filled with a variety of vegetables and sometimes cheese or herbs. Unlike traditional omelettes that may include meat, vegetarian omelettes focus on plant-based ingredients. Common fillings include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Vegetables:</b> Bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, and broccoli.</li>
        <li><b>Cheese:</b> Cheddar, feta, mozzarella, or any other preferred cheese can be added for flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Herbs and Spices:</b> Fresh herbs like parsley, chives, or basil, and spices like salt, pepper, or paprika can enhance the taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To prepare a vegetarian omelette, you generally beat the eggs, pour them into a heated, greased pan, add the desired fillings, and cook until set, folding the omelette in half before serving. It’s a versatile dish that can be customized based on personal preferences and seasonal ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 ounces shredded Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and bell pepper in butter until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Beat together eggs, milk, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.</li>
    <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium heat; swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet with butter. When butter is bubbly, pour in egg mixture and cook undisturbed until the bottom of eggs begin to set, about 1 minute. Gently lift the edges of omelet with a spatula to let any uncooked egg flow onto the skillet. Continue cooking until the center of omelet starts to look dry, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle cheese over omelet, then spoon vegetable mixture over 1/2 of the omelet. Use a spatula to gently fold omelet over vegetables. Cook until cheese melts to desired consistency, about 1 minute. Slide omelet onto a plate. Cut in half and serve.</li>
